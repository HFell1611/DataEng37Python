a string is a list which can be modified
b = "Hello World"

print(b[2:5]) - this will get all letter in position 2 to, but not including, position 5
              - it will print "llo"
print(b[:5])  - this will print everything up to, but not including, position 5
              - it will return "Hello"
print(b[2:])  - this will print everything from position 2 and onwards
              - it will print "llo World"
              - all these work with negative numbers, going back starting at -1
print(b[::-1} - this will print all the letters in the string but backwards in steps of 1
